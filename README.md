# A-B-Firmware-ROM-Updater
This is a over-complicated Firmware and ROM updater for phones that has A/B partitions and often uses payload.bin files for update. This does require that the payload is dumped but using a extractor of sorts (Payload Extrator or Payload Dumper e.g.). After using that this script will guide you through what you need to do afterwards.
